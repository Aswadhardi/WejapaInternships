# Create an HTML List
# Write some code, including a for loop, that iterates over a list of strings and creates a single string, html_str, which is an HTML list. For example, if the list is items = ['first string', 'second string'], printing html_str should output:

# <ul>
# <li>first string</li>
# <li>second string</li>
# </ul>
# That is, the string's first line should be the opening tag <ul>. Following that is one line per element in the source list, surrounded by <li> and </li> tags. The final line of the string should be the closing tag </ul>.

items = ['first string', 'second string']
html_str = "<ul>\n"  # "\ n" is the character that marks the end of the line, it does
# the characters that are after it in html_str are on the next line

# write your code here
for words in items:
    html_str += '<li >'+words+'< /li >\n'
html_str += '</ul>'
print(html_str)
