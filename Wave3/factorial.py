# Factorials with While Loops
# Find the factorial of a number using a while loop.

# A factorial of a whole number is that number multiplied by every whole number between itself and 1. For example, 6 factorial (written "6!") equals 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 720. So 6! = 720.

# We can write a while loop to take any given number and figure out what its factorial is.

# Example: If number is 6, your code should compute and print the product, 720.


# number to find the factorial of
number = 6

# start with our product equal to one
product = 1

# track the current number being multiplied
current = 1

# write your while loop here

# multiply the product so far by the current number

# increment current with each iteration until it reaches number
while current != number:
    product += product * current
    current += 1


# print the factorial of number
print(product)
