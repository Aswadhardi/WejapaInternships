# Break the String
# Write a loop with a break statement to create a string, news_ticker, that is exactly 140 characters long. You should create the news ticker by adding headlines from the headlines list, inserting a space in between each headline. If necessary, truncate the last headline in the middle so that news_ticker is exactly 140 characters long.

# Remember that break works in both for and while loops. Use whichever loop seems most appropriate. Consider adding print statements to your code to help you resolve bugs.

# HINT: modify the headlines list to verify your loop works with different inputs
